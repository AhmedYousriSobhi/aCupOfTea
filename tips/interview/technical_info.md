# Technical Info

When you are doing an interview for any techinical position, there are some important questions you should ask the interviewer about, so let's discuss more about these questions.

Let's assume the applied position is a Data Scientist:

## What is the data team structure?
In this question, you are aiming to get more familier about the structure of the overall data team; this will give you some bigger view about how many data scientists, data analytics, and data engineer in the team.

Regarding the number of data scientist, this will show you the following:
1. If the team is small in numbers, this will give you intuition how the work load will be.
2. If the team is so big, how will be the impact you will add to the team among all these numbers.

But there are one more important points to take into account here:
- The hierarchy of the team, Is there a team lead? is there a manager?; these people are responsible for taking your work and let is shine and reached the other teams to make impact in the company.

Regarding the number of data analysts, this will show you the following:
1. How much the analysts work for the business you will have as a data scientist, if there are no enough data analysts in the team.
2. Also know what are their focus in the team, is it the analysis for the business, or most likely dashboards and visualization tools only.

Regarding the number of data engineers, this will show you the following:
1. Lower number of data engineer, or low level data engineer, will indicate the low quality of database the company will have, which will impact your work as a data scientist, which mostly have to fetch data from database to start you tasks.
2. Low database quality lead to bad tables schema, bad data integrity, and even time cost during work, and when they decide to miagrate the database to better platform.

## What are the future long and short term planning for the team?
This question will tells you, how good the company in planning, so are they just planning for a single quarter, or they have a far end vision of projects to do in the future which will give huge impact to the company.

## How many of the data scientist project deployed?
This question will tells you if the data science team has an impact in the company or not, and their work actually being used in the company by other teams, so the company appreaciated the data science team work.

## What are they technology tools there using?
It is good to know about the team tools they are using like where they are training their models in case of machine learning or deep learning. are they using AWS Sagemaker or all the work are done locally in your machine?
