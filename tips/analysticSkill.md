## Getting Into Domain Knowledge
Getting up to speed with the domain knowledge of a new company is essential for a data scientist to effectively work on their analysis. Here are some steps to quickly acquire domain knowledge:
|Step|Description|
|--|--|
|Company Materials| Start by reading any documentation or materials provided by the company. This could include reports, whitepapers, manuals, or internal wiki pages. It will give you an overview of the company's products, services, and objectives.
|Meetings and Interviews| Schedule meetings with key stakeholders, subject matter experts, and other team members. Conduct interviews to gather information about the domain, the data they work with, and the specific business problems they are trying to solve.
|Ask Questions| Don't hesitate to ask questions, even if they seem basic. Engaging with people and showing a genuine interest in understanding their domain will help you build rapport and learn faster.
|Shadowing| If possible, shadow other team members or attend meetings where they discuss domain-specific topics. This will give you practical insights into how they approach challenges and use data in their decision-making processes.
|Existing Analysis and Reports| Study any existing analysis or reports that have been done within the company. This will help you understand how data has been used in the past and what insights have been gained.
|Industry Research| Research the industry in which the company operates. Understand the current trends, challenges, and opportunities in that industry. This will provide context for the company's data and analysis needs.
|Online Resources| Look for industry-specific resources, forums, and publications where professionals discuss topics related to the company's domain. Online communities can be a great source of knowledge and insights.
|External Data Sources| Explore external data sources related to the company's domain. This can include public datasets, research papers, or government reports. Integrating external data with internal data can lead to more comprehensive analyses.
|Data Exploration| Dive into the company's data. Explore the datasets they have and become familiar with the data structure, variables, and any peculiarities. This hands-on experience will help you grasp the data better.
|Projects and Prototypes| Start with smaller analysis projects or prototypes to gain practical experience. This will allow you to apply your understanding of the domain and validate your insights with real data.
|Continuous Learning| Keep learning and updating your knowledge about the domain regularly. Attend workshops, webinars, or conferences related to the industry to stay informed about the latest developments.
|Build Relationships| Develop strong working relationships with team members, especially those who have domain expertise. They can be valuable resources for ongoing learning and guidance.

Remember, getting up to speed with domain knowledge is a gradual process, and you might not become an expert overnight. Be patient, stay curious, and continuously engage with the domain to improve your understanding over time. Your efforts to acquire domain knowledge will not only help you perform better in data analysis but also make you a more valuable asset to the company.

## Standalone analytic task in new domain knowledge
In a situation where you are given a new dataset from a company without a specific analysis topic and are expected to discover insights on your own, you can follow these steps to effectively approach the analysis:

|Step|Description|
|--|--|
|Data Exploration| Begin by exploring the dataset to get a sense of its structure, the variables it contains, and any potential patterns or trends. Use summary statistics, data visualization techniques, and descriptive analysis to gain initial insights.
|Understand Data Sources| Seek information about the sources of the data and how it was collected. Understanding the data's origins can provide context and help you identify any data quality or bias issues.
|Define Objectives| Based on your initial exploration and understanding of the data, define clear objectives for your analysis. Ask yourself what questions you could potentially answer with the data available and how those insights could be valuable to the company.
|Brainstorm Hypotheses| Formulate hypotheses related to the data and the company's domain. These hypotheses can serve as starting points for deeper analysis.
|Data Cleaning and Preprocessing| Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis. Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies that may affect your results.
|Feature Engineering| If necessary, create new features or variables that might be relevant for your analysis. Feature engineering can enhance the dataset and lead to more informative results.
|Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)| Conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis. Use visualizations and statistical techniques to uncover patterns, correlations, and potential relationships between variables.
|Identify Interesting Patterns| Look for interesting patterns, anomalies, or trends that could be of significance to the company. Keep an open mind during this stage and be willing to adjust your analysis objectives based on your findings.
|Formulate Analysis Questions| Based on your EDA and insights, formulate specific analysis questions that you can address with the data.
|Analysis Methods and Models| Choose appropriate analysis methods and models to answer the questions you formulated. Depending on the nature of the data and the questions, this could involve statistical tests, machine learning algorithms, or other analytical techniques.
|Iterative Process| Remember that data analysis is often an iterative process. As you uncover insights, you may discover new questions and areas to explore. Be flexible in adapting your analysis approach accordingly.
|Interpret Results and Communicate Findings| Once you have completed your analysis, interpret the results and communicate your findings to the company. Use data visualizations and clear explanations to present your insights effectively.
|Provide Actionable Recommendations| Based on your analysis, offer actionable recommendations that the company can use to improve their operations, make data-driven decisions, or gain a competitive advantage.
|Document Your Process| Document your analysis process thoroughly, including the steps you took, the decisions you made, and the rationale behind them. This documentation will be useful for future reference or if other team members need to review your work.

Remember that in a scenario where you are expected to discover analysis topics on your own, creativity and curiosity play a significant role. Stay curious, think critically, and be willing to explore different angles to uncover meaningful insights from the data.
