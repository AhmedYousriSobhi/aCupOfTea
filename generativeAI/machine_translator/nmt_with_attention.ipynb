Keras expects `(inputs, labels)` pairs, the inputs are the `(context, target_in)` and the labels are `target_out`. The difference between `target_in` and `target_out` is that they are shifted by one step relative to eachother, so that at each location the label is the next token."

    "The short sentences often work well, but if the input is too long the model literally loses focus and stops providing reasonable predictions. There are two main reasons for this:\n",

    "1. The model was trained with teacher-forcing feeding the correct token at each step, regardless of the model's predictions. The model could be made more robust if it were sometimes fed its own predictions.\n",
    "2. The model only has access to its previous output through the RNN state. If the RNN state looses track of where it was in the context sequence there's no way for the model to recover. [Transformers](transformer.ipynb) improve on this by letting the decoder look at what it has output so far."
