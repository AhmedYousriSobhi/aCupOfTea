# What is Kubernets?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy applications across multiple hosts, and it provides a number of features that make it easy to manage and scale applications.

![kubernets](https://kubernetes.io/images/docs/components-of-kubernetes.svg)

Kubernetes is based on the concept of a cluster. A cluster is a group of machines that work together to run containerized applications. Kubernetes uses a master node to manage the cluster. The master node is responsible for scheduling containers to the worker nodes, and it also monitors the health of the cluster.

The **worker nodes** are the machines that run the containers. Kubernetes automatically distributes the containers to the worker nodes based on a number of factors, such as the availability of resources and the load on the nodes.

## Provided Features
Kubernetes provides a number of features that make it easy to manage and scale containerized applications. These features include:
|Feature|Description|
|-|-|
|Deployment| Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy containerized applications to a cluster. You can use Kubernetes to deploy a single container or a group of containers.
|Scaling| Kubernetes makes it easy to scale containerized applications up or down. You can scale applications manually or automatically based on demand.
|Health monitoring| Kubernetes monitors the health of the containers in a cluster. If a container fails, Kubernetes will automatically restart it.
|Service discovery| Kubernetes makes it easy for containers to discover each other. This makes it easy to build distributed applications.
|Load balancing| Kubernetes can load balance traffic across the containers in a cluster. This makes it easy to ensure that traffic is distributed evenly across the cluster.

Kubernetes is a powerful tool that can be used to manage and scale containerized applications. It is a popular choice for organizations that are looking to build and deploy scalable applications.

## Benefits of Using
Here are some of the benefits of using Kubernetes:
|Benefit|Details|
|-|-|
|Scalability| Kubernetes makes it easy to scale your applications up or down based on demand. This can save you money on infrastructure costs.
|Availability| Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers, which helps to improve the availability of your applications.
|Manageability| Kubernetes provides a number of features that make it easy to manage your applications, such as deployment, scaling, and health monitoring.
|Portability| Kubernetes can be used to deploy applications on a variety of platforms, including on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid environments.
