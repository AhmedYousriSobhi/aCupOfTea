# What is Memory Coalescing?
Memory Coalescing optimizes memory access patterns by fetching contiguous blocks of data, even if not all threads within the block need all parts of the block. This optimization improves overall memory access performance and efficiency in GPU computing

# Let's hear a story about GPU Kingdom
This story is made by ChatGPT 3.5, answering the question "what is memory coalescing? try to explain like a story mode"

> Alright, let's embark on a journey through the land of GPU memory to understand the tale of memory coalescing.

> Once upon a time, in a kingdom not too far away, there existed a grand castle known as the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This mighty castle was home to thousands of tiny chambers called threads, each with its own small storage space known as registers.

> Now, the threads within the castle worked tirelessly on various tasks assigned to them. They often needed to fetch data from the kingdom's memory, a vast expanse beyond the castle walls. However, fetching data was not as simple as reaching out and grabbing it. The memory beyond the walls was organized into rows and columns, much like a vast field of crops.

> Here's where our tale truly begins. As the threads ventured out to fetch their required data, they realized that they were not alone. Many of their fellow threads also sought data from neighboring fields in the memory. The threads, being clever workers, realized that they could join forces and work together to gather their data more efficiently.

> Memory coalescing was born from this realization. It was a strategy where neighboring threads collaborated to fetch contiguous blocks of data from memory. Instead of each thread making individual trips to the memory fields, they formed groups and marched together, each thread taking its share of the harvest.

> This cooperative approach brought great benefits to the kingdom. By fetching data in contiguous blocks, the threads minimized the number of memory transactions required, reducing the time needed to gather their data. The kingdom's productivity soared, and tasks were completed with remarkable speed.

> However, like any tale, there were challenges along the way. If the threads were not organized properly or if they strayed too far from their neighbors, the benefits of memory coalescing diminished. Instead of a harmonious procession, the threads stumbled over each other, causing delays and inefficiencies.

> Thus, the wise overseers of the kingdom reminded the threads of the importance of cooperation and alignment. They taught them to organize themselves in orderly patterns and to fetch data in harmony with their neighbors. With diligence and discipline, the threads mastered the art of memory coalescing, and the kingdom prospered like never before.

> And so, memory coalescing became a cherished chapter in the story of GPU computing—a tale of cooperation, efficiency, and the power of working together toward a common goal.

# Why so?
Why they form a group of threads to go to memory and fetch data on same time?

Following up the answer above from ChatGPT 3.5, it generated this answer:

> Imagine you have a group of villagers in a farming community, and they all need to collect apples from an orchard. Each villager has a specific tree assigned to them from which they need to pick apples.

> Now, if each villager goes to the orchard individually and picks apples from their assigned tree, it would result in chaos and inefficiency. They would crisscross paths, bump into each other, and waste time traveling between trees.

> Instead, if the villagers organize themselves into groups, where each group focuses on a specific section of the orchard, they can work more efficiently. Each member of the group still picks apples from their assigned tree, but they do so in a coordinated manner. This way, they minimize the distance traveled and optimize their efforts.

> In the context of memory coalescing:
> 
>   The "villagers" represent threads in the GPU.
> 
>   The "orchard" represents the GPU memory.
> 
>   The "trees" represent memory locations containing data.

> When threads are grouped together to fetch data from memory, they coordinate their efforts to access contiguous blocks of memory. This allows the memory controller to efficiently fetch the data in a single transaction, rather than making multiple smaller transactions for each individual thread. As a result, memory access is more streamlined, and the overall performance is improved.

# Why Thread Does not Fetch Data From Another Thread?
Continuing chatting with ChatGPT 3.5, this answer was generated:

> Now, regarding your concern about threads fetching data from other threads:

> In GPU programming, each thread typically operates independently and doesn't directly fetch data from other threads. Instead, threads access data from global memory, which is shared across all threads. The goal of memory coalescing is to optimize the access pattern to this global memory, ensuring that neighboring threads access contiguous blocks of data. This optimization helps to minimize memory transactions and improve overall performance without threads needing to fetch data from each other directly.

# So Threads Fetch Whole block of Data, but Uses a Small Part?
Continuing chatting with ChatGPT 3.5, this answer was generated:

> In GPU programming, threads are often organized into blocks, and these blocks are scheduled to execute on streaming multiprocessors (SMs) in groups. Each thread within a block may have different tasks, but they often access neighboring memory locations. When we talk about memory coalescing, we're aiming to optimize the memory access patterns of these threads.

> Let's consider your scenario with two threads fetching a block of memory. If both threads need the first part of the data block, here's what happens:

>     Memory Access Request: Both threads within the block issue memory access requests for the first part of the data block.

>     Coalesced Access: The memory controller recognizes that the threads within the block are accessing contiguous memory locations (the first part of the data block). It then fetches the entire block of data into a cache or registers. This is the essence of memory coalescing—fetching contiguous memory locations in a single transaction, even if not all threads need all parts of the block.

>     Data Usage: Each thread within the block retrieves the data it needs from the cached or registered block. Threads that need the first part of the block can access it directly, while threads needing other parts may have to do some additional computations to access their required data within the block.

>     Unused Data: In the case where some threads within the block do not need all parts of the block, there may be some unused data in the cached or registered block. However, this inefficiency is outweighed by the benefits of memory coalescing, which include reduced memory access latency and increased memory bandwidth utilization.

# Do Threads Fetch The Data Themselves?
What I understood so far is that: Threads in a SM they decide all the data they need, and the one responsible for fetching the data is the memory controller and not the threads themselves?

Answering this question by ChatGPT 3.5:

> That's correct! In GPU programming, threads within a streaming multiprocessor (SM) do not directly fetch data from memory themselves. Instead, they issue memory access requests, and it's the responsibility of the memory controller to handle these requests and fetch the required data from memory.

> Here's how it typically works:

>     Thread Execution: Threads within an SM execute instructions as per their program logic. When a thread needs to access data from memory (e.g., read from an array), it issues a memory access request specifying the memory address it wants to access.

>     Memory Access Request: This memory access request is sent from the thread to the memory controller. The request includes the memory address the thread wants to access and the type of memory operation (read or write).

>     Memory Controller Operation: The memory controller receives the memory access request from the thread. It is responsible for coordinating memory accesses across multiple threads and ensuring efficient access to memory resources.

>     Data Fetching: Based on the memory access request received from the thread, the memory controller fetches the required data from memory. This may involve accessing various levels of memory hierarchy, such as caches or global memory,  depending on the memory access pattern and the memory hierarchy of the GPU architecture.

>     Data Delivery: Once the required data is fetched, the memory controller delivers it to the requesting thread. The thread can then continue its execution using the fetched data.

> By centralizing the memory access control and management in the memory controller, GPUs can efficiently handle memory access requests from multiple threads running concurrently on the SMs. This allows for high-throughput memory access operations, which are essential for achieving high-performance computation in GPU-accelerated applications.
