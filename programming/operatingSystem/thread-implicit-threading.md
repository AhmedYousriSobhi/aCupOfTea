# Operating System - Implicit Threading

You don't need to micromanage every task my dear king!!

**The Tale of Implicit Threading**

Imagine a bustling kingdom where the King has a monumental task: building a grand castle. The King, wise and efficient, wants to ensure the castle is built quickly without having to micromanage every worker. In this kingdom, there are two approaches to getting the job done: explicit and implicit management.

***Explicit Management (Manual Work Allocation)***

In the explicit management approach, the King personally assigns tasks to each worker. He tells each builder which stone to place, which wall to erect, and when to take a break. This requires the King to constantly supervise and allocate tasks, ensuring each worker knows exactly what to do and when. This method, while effective, takes up a lot of the King's time and energy, which could be better spent on other royal duties.

***Implicit Management (Automatic Work Allocation)***

In the implicit management approach, the King employs a wise and magical overseer named Thready. Thready's job is to oversee the workers and automatically allocate tasks based on their skills and the current needs of the project. Thready ensures that workers are always busy with the most appropriate tasks without needing constant instructions from the King. This way, the King can focus on planning the grand design of the castle rather than managing the minutiae of the construction.

**What is Implicit Threading?**

Implicit threading is like the magical overseer Thready. It refers to the technique where the responsibility of managing and distributing tasks among workers (threads) is handled by the system or library itself, rather than being explicitly coded by the programmer. This makes the task of parallel programming easier and more efficient.

**Examples of Implicit Threading**
1. ***Thread Pools***
    - Think of a thread pool as a group of workers standing by, ready to take on tasks as they come. Instead of creating and destroying threads for each new task, which is costly and time-consuming, a thread pool reuses existing threads. The King doesn’t need to hire and fire workers for each stone to be laid; Thready assigns tasks to the available workers in the pool.
2. ***OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing)***
    - OpenMP is like a set of magical spells that can be cast on portions of code to automatically parallelize them. When the King writes down the plan for building a wall, he can use these spells to tell Thready to divide the work among the workers without specifying exactly how. This makes it easier to add parallelism to the construction plans without detailed instructions.
3. ***Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)***
    - GCD is another form of implicit threading used in Apple’s ecosystem. Imagine Thready having a magical book where tasks are written down, and workers can pick them up as they become available. This system dynamically manages the tasks and distributes them among workers, optimizing for performance without the King’s constant intervention.

**Benefits of Implicit Threading**
- Efficiency: Just like how Thready efficiently manages the workers, implicit threading optimizes the use of system resources, leading to better performance and reduced overhead.
- Simplicity: The King doesn’t have to worry about the nitty-gritty details of task management. Similarly, programmers don’t need to write complex code to manage threads explicitly.
- Scalability: As the number of tasks increases, Thready can handle them smoothly without overwhelming the King. Implicit threading mechanisms can scale to handle more threads and tasks as needed.
