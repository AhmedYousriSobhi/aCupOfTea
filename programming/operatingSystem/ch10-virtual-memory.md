# 10.4. Page Replacement
## 10.4.2. FIFI Page Replacement
### Belady's Anomaly
Belady's anomaly is a phenomenon in computer science, specifically in the context of page replacement algorithms used in virtual memory systems. It describes a counterintuitive situation where increasing the number of page frames (memory) allocated to a process can actually result in an increase in the number of page faults, rather than the expected decrease. This anomaly is most famously associated with the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) page replacement algorithm.

Under FIFO, pages are replaced in the order they were brought into memory, and adding more frames does not necessarily reduce the number of page faults because it does not consider the frequency or recency of page accesses.

From the reference:
```
for some page-replacement algorithms, the page-fault rate may increase as the number of allocated frames increases. 
We would expect that giving more memory to a process would improve its performance. 
In some early research, investigators noticed that this assumption was not always true. 
Beladyâ€™s anomaly was discovered as a result.

## 10.4.4. LRU Page-Replacement
- Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement is a commonly used algorithm for managing memory pages in a computer system. 
- It works by tracking the pages that have been used recently and replacing the least recently used page when a new page needs to be loaded into memory. However, implementing pure LRU can be costly in terms of time and space, so several enhancements have been developed to approximate LRU more efficiently.

1. LRU approximation algorithms
2. Second-chance algorithm

## 10.4.5. LRU Approximation Page Replacement
1. LRU approximation algorithms
    - Reference bit
      - With each page associate a bit, initially = 0
      - When page is referenced bit set to 1
      - Replace any with reference bit = 0 (if one exists)
        - We do not know the order, however

2. Second-Chance Algorithm
    - Generally FIFO, plus hardware-provided reference bit
    - Clock replacement
    - If page to be replaced has 
      - Reference bit = 0 -> replace it
      - reference bit = 1 then:
        - set reference bit 0, leave page in memory
        - replace next page, subject to same rules
