## What kinds of data structures are optimal for use in HPC solutions?
### Answer
In HPC solutions, data structures should be designed to minimize data contention and maximize data locality. Data structures that are well suited for HPC solutions include arrays, linked lists, and trees.
### Explanation
**Data contention** is a situation where multiple processors are trying to access the same data at the same time. This can lead to performance problems, as the processors will have to wait for each other to finish accessing the data.

**Data locality** is the property of data being close to the processor that needs it. This is important for HPC solutions, as it can reduce the amount of time that the processor has to spend fetching data from memory.

#### Data structure Types fits for HPC: [Arrays, Linked List, Trees]
Arrays are a good choice for HPC solutions because they are efficient for both data access and data locality. Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, which means that the processor can access the entire array without having to move to different memory locations. This can improve data locality.

Linked lists are a good choice for HPC solutions because they are efficient for data insertion and deletion. Linked lists are stored as a collection of nodes, where each node contains a pointer to the next node in the list. This makes it easy to insert and delete nodes from the list.

Trees are a good choice for HPC solutions because they are efficient for data searching and sorting. Trees are stored as a hierarchical structure, where each node in the tree has one or more child nodes. This makes it easy to search and sort data in the tree.

Here are some examples of how these data structures can be used in HPC solutions:
- Arrays can be used to store large matrices of data, such as the data used in computational fluid dynamics simulations.
- Linked lists can be used to store data that is constantly changing, such as the data used in event-driven simulations.
- Trees can be used to store data that is sorted, such as the data used in database management systems.

In general, the best data structure to use in an HPC solution depends on the specific requirements of the solution. However, arrays, linked lists, and trees are good choices for many HPC solutions.

## What kind of operating systems are suitable for high performance computing clusters?
### Answer
In general, any type of Unix operating system is suitable for high performance computing clusters. This includes popular choices such as Linux and FreeBSD. However, there are also specialized high performance computing operating systems such as Rocks Cluster Distribution and Red Hat Enterprise Linux High Performance Computing.

## What are some basic characteristics of an HPC solution?
### Answer
There are four main characteristics of an HPC solution: scalability, reliability, performance, and efficiency. 
- Scalability refers to the ability of the system to grow in size and complexity as needed. 
- Reliability means that the system can be relied upon to work correctly and consistently. 
- Performance refers to the speed and responsiveness of the system. 
- Efficiency means that the system uses resources in an efficient manner.
