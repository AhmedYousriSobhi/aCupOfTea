# Real-State Company

## What is a real-state company?
A real estate company, also known as a real estate agency or brokerage, is a business that deals with the buying, selling, renting, or management of properties. These properties can include residential houses, commercial buildings, land, and other real estate assets.

Real estate companies typically employ licensed real estate agents or brokers who assist clients in various real estate transactions. They act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, helping clients navigate the complex process of buying or selling properties.

Real estate companies offer a range of services, including property listing and marketing, property valuation, market analysis, property management, and investment advice. They may specialize in specific types of properties, such as residential, commercial, or industrial real estate, or focus on particular geographical areas.

The main sources of revenue for real estate companies are commissions earned from successful property transactions. When a property is sold or rented through the company, a percentage of the transaction value is paid as a commission to the real estate agent or broker involved.

In addition to traditional real estate companies, there are also online platforms and technology-driven startups that offer alternative models for buying, selling, or renting properties. These companies often leverage digital tools and platforms to streamline the real estate process and provide more transparency and convenience to clients.

It's worth noting that real estate practices and regulations can vary between countries and regions, so the specific operations and requirements of a real estate company can differ depending on the location.

## KPIs
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for real estate companies can vary based on their specific business model and goals. However, here are some common KPIs that are often tracked in the real estate industry:

|KPI|Definition|
|-|-|
|__Sales Volume__| This KPI measures the total value of property sales or rentals generated by the company within a specific period. It provides an overview of the company's revenue-generating activities.|
|__Gross Commission Income (GCI)__| GCI is the total amount of commission earned from property transactions. It is calculated by applying the commission percentage to the sales volume. GCI reflects the company's financial performance and revenue streams.|
|__Average Sales Price__| This KPI calculates the average selling price of properties sold or rented by the company. It helps gauge the company's market positioning and the value of properties in its portfolio.
|__Time on Market__| Time on Market measures the average number of days it takes for a property to sell or rent after it is listed. It reflects the company's efficiency in marketing and attracting potential buyers or tenants.
|__Occupancy Rate__| This KPI is particularly relevant for companies involved in property management or leasing. It measures the percentage of properties that are currently occupied or rented out, indicating the company's ability to maintain high occupancy levels.
|__Customer Satisfaction__| This KPI assesses the level of satisfaction among clients who have engaged with the company's services. It can be measured through customer surveys, feedback ratings, or online reviews.
|__Return on Investment (ROI)__| ROI measures the profitability of real estate investments made by the company. It compares the gains or income generated from investments against the initial investment cost.
|__Market Share__| Market share indicates the company's portion of the overall real estate market in a specific area or segment. It helps assess the company's competitive position and market presence.
|__Lead Conversion Rate__| This KPI measures the percentage of leads or inquiries that successfully convert into actual property sales or rentals. It reflects the company's sales and marketing effectiveness.
|__Cost per Acquisition__| Cost per Acquisition calculates the average cost incurred by the company to acquire a new client or close a property transaction. It helps evaluate the efficiency of marketing and sales efforts.

These are just a few examples of KPIs that real estate companies commonly track. The specific KPIs can vary based on the company's objectives, business model, and areas of focus.

## KPI Calculation
Here are the calculations for some of the key performance indicators (KPIs) mentioned earlier:

|KPI|Calculation|
|-|-|
|Sales Volume|Calculation: Total value of property sales or rentals generated by the company within a specific period. <br/>Example: If a real estate company sold properties worth $5 million and rented properties worth $3 million in a year, the sales volume would be $8 million.|
|Gross Commission Income (GCI)|Calculation: Total amount of commission earned from property transactions. <br/>Example: If the company's commission rate is 5% and the sales volume is $8 million, the GCI would be $400,000 ($8 million * 0.05).
|Average Sales Price|Calculation: Average selling price of properties sold or rented by the company. <br/>Example: If the company sold 100 properties with a total sales volume of $8 million, the average sales price would be $80,000 ($8 million / 100).|
|Time on Market|Calculation: Average number of days it takes for a property to sell or rent after it is listed. <br/>Example: If the company's listed properties took a total of 500 days to sell or rent and there were 100 properties listed, the average time on market would be 5 days (500 days / 100 properties)|
|Occupancy Rate|Calculation: Percentage of properties that are currently occupied or rented out. <br/>Example: If the company manages 200 properties and 180 of them are currently rented, the occupancy rate would be 90% (180 rented properties / 200 total properties * 100).|
|Return on Investment (ROI)|Calculation: (Gains or Income - Initial Investment Cost) / Initial Investment Cost * 100. <br/>Example: If an investment property generates rental income of $50,000 per year and the initial investment cost was $500,000, the ROI would be 10% (($50,000 - $500,000) / $500,000 * 100)|

These calculations are just examples, and the specific formulas and data required may vary depending on the company's needs and the KPI being measured. It's important to adapt the calculations based on the specific context and data available to the real estate company.
