## What is HPC Systems?
HPC systems, or high-performance computing systems, are powerful computers that can perform complex calculations at very high speeds. They are used in a wide range of fields, including science, engineering, medicine, and finance, to solve problems that would be too time-consuming or impossible to solve on a regular computer.

HPC systems are typically made up of clusters of hundreds or even thousands of individual computers that work together in parallel to process data and perform calculations. This allows them to achieve much higher performance than a single computer could on its own.

## HPC Systems Tasks
HPC systems are used for a variety of tasks, including:
|Task|Description|
|--|--|
|Simulating complex systems| HPC systems can be used to create simulations of complex systems, such as the weather, the human brain, and the climate. These simulations can be used to predict future events, design new products, and test new treatments for diseases.
|Analyzing large datasets| HPC systems can be used to analyze large datasets, such as those generated by scientific experiments and financial transactions. This analysis can be used to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that would be difficult or impossible to spot manually.
|Rendering complex images| HPC systems can be used to render complex images, such as those used in movies and video games. This rendering can be done much faster than on a regular computer, allowing for the creation of more realistic and detailed images.

## Examples of HPC Systems
