# Extreme Correlation

## Should we remove features with __high__ correlation between each other?

Removing features with high correlation to each other, also known as multicollinearity (a statistical concept where several independent variables in a model are correlated), can be beneficial in certain cases. Here are a few points to consider when deciding whether to remove highly correlated features from the model:

  1- Improved Model Interpretability: Highly correlated features can introduce redundancy and make it challenging to interpret the individual impact of each feature on the target variable. Removing correlated features can help in simplifying the model and improving interpretability.

  2- Enhanced Model Stability: Multicollinearity can lead to instability in the model's coefficients and predictions. Removing highly correlated features can help in stabilizing the model and reducing the variability in the results.

  3- Mitigating Overfitting: Highly correlated features can contribute to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data. Removing correlated features can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization capability.

However, it's important to note that removing features solely based on correlation should be done carefully, considering the specific context and the overall performance of the model. Some considerations include:

- Domain Knowledge: Consider the domain expertise and prior knowledge about the features. Features that are known to have a strong relationship with the target variable may be retained even if they are correlated with other features.

- Impact on Model Performance: Assess the impact of removing correlated features on the model's performance metrics. Removing a correlated feature may or may not improve the model's performance, and it is essential to evaluate the model's performance with and without the correlated features.

- Retaining Important Information: Highly correlated features might still contain unique information that contributes to the target variable prediction. Removing such features may result in loss of valuable information. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully evaluate the trade-off between reducing multicollinearity and retaining important information.

In summary, removing highly correlated features can be beneficial in certain scenarios to improve model interpretability, stability, and mitigate overfitting. However, the decision should be based on careful consideration of domain knowledge, model performance, and the trade-off between reducing multicollinearity and retaining valuable information.

## Should we remove features with __low__ correlation between each other?

Removing features with low correlation to each other, also known as low inter-feature correlation, can be considered in certain cases. Here are a few points to consider when deciding whether to remove features with low correlation from the model:

 1- Feature Relevance: Low inter-feature correlation could indicate that a particular feature has minimal influence on the target variable. Removing such features can help simplify the model by focusing on the most informative features.

 2- Dimensionality Reduction: Eliminating features with low correlation can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, making the model more manageable and potentially improving computational efficiency.

 3- Enhanced Model Interpretability: By removing features with low correlation, the model becomes more interpretable as it focuses on the most influential features. It becomes easier to understand the relationship between these important features and the target variable.

 4- Avoiding Noise: Low correlated features may introduce noise to the model and potentially impact its performance. By removing these features, the model can focus on more reliable and informative predictors.

However, it's essential to consider the following points before removing features with low correlation:

- Domain Knowledge: Consider the domain expertise and prior knowledge about the features. Features that are known to be relevant and have theoretical significance in the context of the problem should be retained, even if they have low correlation with other features.

- Model Performance: Evaluate the impact of removing low correlated features on the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or any other relevant metrics. Removing a feature with low correlation may or may not impact the model's performance significantly.

- Interaction Effects: Even though individual features may have low correlation, they might still contribute to interactions with other features, leading to a significant impact on the target variable. In such cases, removing low correlated features might result in the loss of important interactions.

- Future Predictive Power: Features with low correlation in the current dataset might have predictive power when combined with other datasets or in future scenarios. It's important to consider the potential utility of these features in future analyses.

In summary, removing features with low correlation can be considered to simplify the model, enhance interpretability, and potentially improve performance. However, it's crucial to balance this decision with domain knowledge, model performance evaluation, consideration of interaction effects, and potential future utility of the features.
